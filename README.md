I want a few images that I can use to sanity-check DSP algorithms. I've spent a net total of a couple hours searching for a wget-able source of ~500 images of varied scenes, but I can't find a single set, so this is a scraped together group of images.

These images are all different sizes, but they're all in the tiff format.
